ICON PLACEHOLDER

Before building the application, you need to add an icon file.

Required: icon.png (512x512 pixels)

Quick options:
1. Use any 512x512 PNG image as a temporary icon
2. Create a custom icon using online tools:
   - https://favicon.io/
   - https://www.canva.com/
   - https://www.icongenerator.com/

3. Design your own with:
   - Adobe Illustrator
   - Figma
   - Inkscape (free)

Place the icon.png file in this assets/ directory before building.

For testing purposes, you can use any square PNG image.
